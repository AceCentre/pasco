### What makes it **unique**?

Note we definitely aren't trying to make something that already exists. There are many solutions those less visually impaired or with greater physical access can use - and **should** use! However if you want a purely auditory scanning interface you may want some features that these options struggle to provide as they try and meet the needs of a greater selection of indviduals. So what can we provide in pasco for auditory scanning?

* Lets imagine you want a auditory cue in one language - but output your main "voice" in another. Thats difficult to do right now in many commercial solutions
* If you want rapid 'pre' auditory scan - a auditory cue that is like quickly visually scanning the interface in front of you
* You want a recorded audio file (e.g. someones actual voice) for the main spoken output - and a different recorded audio file for the cue.
* Because the language file doesnt have pictures why can't you just write out somones list of phrases and messages in a text file?
* you want a way of scanning in-app in a special way - but be able to use the **entire** device too - not just in a really slow in-efficient way that is great for all other apps - but not communication.
* as well as simple text files wouldnt it be great to import and export to different communication apps? After all, your language is **yours** not a software companies.
