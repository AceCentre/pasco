pasco - Engineered by Ace Centre

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.300 align:middle line:84%
pasco is a communication app that is designed for people 
who have difficulty speaking and

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.333 align:middle line:84%
have a physical impairment along with a visual impairment.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:36.883 align:middle line:84%
Pasco works like having a friend read out a list of 
items and you select one of them when you hear the one you want.

00:00:36.883 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Pasco puts these lists in a electronic format.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.716 align:middle line:84%
It is designed to work well for one, two or more switches.

00:00:57.716 --> 00:01:02.083 align:middle line:84%
These are buttons that you can press with your hand, 
head or other body part

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:07.816 align:middle line:84%
Or directly on-screen with a finger using the navigation
 cursor that can be resized and moved how you need it.

00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
To get started you need to plug in your switches or pair 
them with your device and then configure them in the settings.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
pasco has two different speaking voices; used for different purposes.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.666 align:middle line:84%
Firstly one is for the pasco user. Often the user has this voice

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:29.533 align:middle line:84%
playing to them in some headphones or a small speaker. 
Its designed just for them so they can hear whats being said on screen.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.666 align:middle line:84%
We call this the "cue" or "private"

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.183 align:middle line:84%
voice. Secondly the other voice is for the communication 
partner - the

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:36.516 align:middle line:84%
person the pasco user is talking to. We call this 
the main or public voice.

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:40.516 align:middle line:84%
When the pasco user hears the correct cue element 
they can press their select button

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:44.516 align:middle line:84%
- or tap right on the screen navigation menu - 
and it outputs the speech to the

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:51.033 align:middle line:84%
main voice so everyone can hear them.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:55.033 align:middle line:84%
pasco can be setup and used in a number of different
 ways depending on your needs.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:59.033 align:middle line:84%
On the following page there are some quick settings to 
get you  started. You can

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:03.033 align:middle line:84%
change the locale that changes the language of the apps settings and menus.

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:07.033 align:middle line:84%
There's also an example vocabulary file - something that we call a "tree".

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:11.033 align:middle line:84%
There is your cue and main voice settings and there
 are also some simplified settings

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:15.033 align:middle line:84%
of how you want to access it.  Just remember - there are 
many more settings available in the settings

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:20.933 align:middle line:84%
screen once you have started. Including ways of 
changing the switch actions and voice details.

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Once in the app you'll find a "help" button which gives
 you some quick details of these settings.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.883 align:middle line:84%
The "play" button enables you to go back to the main 
screen of "playing" the pasco tree.

00:02:32.883 --> 00:02:33.566 align:middle line:84%
There is also an edit button. This allows you to quickly
 change the vocabulary.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:37.566 align:middle line:84%
Use the plus and minus buttons to add or remove new elements

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:42.666 align:middle line:84%
and type into the text area your main voice words 
- and in brackets a cue if you need it.

00:02:42.666 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Just remember to use the navigation arrow to move around the tree.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Just remember to use the navigation arrow to move around the tree.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more you can do with pasco, including 
controlling your lights and sending text messages

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and to find out more have a read of the manual.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
We hope the app is useful - and if you have any feedback
 we'd love to hear from you
